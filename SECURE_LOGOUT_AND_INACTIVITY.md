# Secure Logout and Inactivity Features

## Features Implemented

### 1. Secure Logout with Complete Cache Clearing
- When a user logs out, all cached data is cleared to prevent data sharing between users
- Clears:
  - localStorage
  - sessionStorage
  - Service worker caches
  - Authentication tokens
- Broadcasts logout event to all open tabs
- Automatically redirects to login page

### 2. Automatic Logout After 10 Minutes of Inactivity
- Tracks user activity (mouse, keyboard, touch, scroll events)
- Automatically logs out user after 10 minutes of no activity
- Handles:
  - Tab visibility changes (pause/resume timer)
  - Browser tab close/reopen (persists last activity time)
  - Multiple tabs (synchronized logout across all tabs)

### 3. Optional Visual Countdown Timer
- Shows countdown when less than 5 minutes remain
- Warning display when less than 2 minutes remain
- Can be added to any page with the InactivityCountdown component

## Implementation Details

### Files Added
1. `/hooks/useInactivityTimer.js` - Main inactivity tracking logic
2. `/components/InactivityWrapper.jsx` - Wrapper component for the app
3. `/components/InactivityCountdown.jsx` - Optional visual countdown
4. `/components/InactivityCountdown.css` - Countdown styles

### Files Modified

// In your component
<InactivityCountdown />
```
