- ✅ Standardized error handling in services to leverage apiService's interceptors

#### 2. Streamlined Socket Management
- ✅ Confirmed that `socketClient.jsx` and `socketService.jsx` provide a unified interface for socket operations
- ✅ Updated both socket services to use structured logging via the logger utility
- ✅ Connected both services properly to ensure they work together efficiently

#### 3. Consolidated Configuration & Constants
- ✅ Created consistent patterns for service initialization and configuration 
- ✅ Removed hardcoded values where possible
