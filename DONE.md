# Refactoring Progress Report

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundational Cleanup & Centralization

#### 1. Centralized API Interactions
- ✅ Ensured that all services use `apiService.jsx` for API calls
- ✅ Replaced direct `fetch` calls in `socketClient.jsx` with `apiService`
- ✅ Standardized error handling in services to leverage apiService's interceptors
- ✅ Improved token handling in apiService by using its own methods for token refresh
- ✅ Replaced direct localStorage/sessionStorage access with tokenStorage utilities in multiple services
- ✅ Fixed socketClient.jsx to use apiService and tokenStorage utilities
- ✅ Fixed ChatService.js to use tokenStorage utility instead of direct token access
- ✅ Replaced direct XMLHttpRequest usage with apiService.upload in useChat.js and Messages.jsx
- ✅ Standardized file upload handling across the application

#### 2. Streamlined Socket Management
- ✅ Confirmed that `socketClient.jsx` and `socketService.jsx` provide a unified interface for socket operations
- ✅ Updated both socket services to use structured logging via the logger utility
- ✅ Connected both services properly to ensure they work together efficiently
- ✅ Removed direct socket usage in components, ensured all socket interactions go through socketService
- ✅ Fixed direct socket.socket usage in NotificationsComponent.jsx and NotificationContext.jsx
- ✅ Implemented proper event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Verified proper socket usage throughout the application

#### 3. Consolidated Configuration & Constants
- ✅ Created consistent patterns for service initialization and configuration 
- ✅ Removed hardcoded values where possible
- ✅ Ensured that server URLs and other configurations are managed consistently
- ✅ Moved hardcoded timeout values from ChatService.js to config.js
- ✅ Consolidated UI configuration values in App.jsx (animations, toast settings, analytics)
- ✅ Created centralized configuration sections for timeouts, animations, account tiers, and message types
- ✅ Refactored chatConstants.js to use values from config.js for consistency

#### 4. Code Cleanup
- ✅ Replaced all `console.log` statements with structured logging using `logger.js`
- ✅ Identified and marked duplicate utility functions as deprecated
- ✅ Encouraged consistent patterns through deprecation warnings
- ✅ Added cross-referencing to ensure code uses the centralized utilities
- ✅ Replaced console.log/warn/error statements with structured logger in Messages.jsx
