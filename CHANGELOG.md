### Phase 3: Remove Duplication
- ✅ Extracted duplicate chat functionality into `useChatMessages` hook
- ✅ Created reusable UI components for common patterns
- ✅ Standardized API call patterns across components
- ✅ Removed unused imports and code

### Phase 4: Service Integration
- ✅ Standardized socket service to reuse authentication logic
- ✅ Created consistent error handling for socket events
- ✅ Centralized socket event registration in hooks

### Phase 5: Testing and Cleanup
