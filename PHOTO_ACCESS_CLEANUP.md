# Photo Access Code Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Debug Logging
- Removed unnecessary `log.debug()` statements from UserCard.jsx and PermissionsContext.jsx
- Kept only essential error logging
- Removed verbose debug logs for photo access checks, cache operations, and API responses

### 2. Code Simplification
- Created `clearUserCardCache` helper function to eliminate duplicate code
- Removed development-specific comments
- Restored cache time to production value (5 minutes)
- Removed unused test files

### 3. Optimizations
- Fixed dependency array in UserCard's photo access check
- Removed caching of "none" status to prevent temporary states from being persisted
- Consolidated cache clearing logic into a single reusable function

## Result
The photo access feature now:
- Works correctly with proper cache invalidation
- Has minimal debug logging for production
- Uses cleaner, more maintainable code
- Maintains all functionality while reducing code complexity
